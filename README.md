# OIBSIP-Level2-Task2-Tribute-Page 

With a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, I have created a page for someone I admire. I wrote about that person, added his images, gave an appealing layout and used paragraphs appropriately. I also played around with different font styles and background colors. 

This is a tribute page to Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, sir.
